       "   'The advancement of Digital Financial Services (DFS) necessitates a comprehensive understanding of financial literacy in order to promote financial inclusion. Without proper comprehension of financial literacy, the sustainability of financial inclusion is impossible. Financial inclusiveness is not only a significant goal of Sustainable Development Goals(SDGs) announced by the United Nations but also a core objective of Bangladesh Vision 2041 and its’ Strategic plan for 2020-2024. Moreover, in the National Financial Inclusion Strategy of Bangladesh (NFIS-B), “Promoting Financial Literacy and consumer empowerment” is the vital focus area. Financial Literacy provides the knowledge necessary to make informed financial decisions about credit, budgeting, debt, investing, retirement and so on. On the other hand, Financial Inclusion is necessary to ensure access to services like banking, credit, etc. Both financial literacy and financial inclusion are critical components of creating healthy, secure communities, and when they are combined, they can make a substantial impact on improving the lives of individuals and families.',\n",

To bring the dream come true, and to work simultaneously with its beliefs, City Bank acts in accordance with Bangladesh Bank’s Financial Literacy Guideline and works as one of the prominent Financial Literacy Providers (FLPs).\",\n",
       "   'As the very first step towards this road map, the City Bank has formed Financial Literacy Wing(FLW) for keeping up with the Financial Literacy Guidelines (FLGs). This wing will be at the forefront of the financial inclusiveness initiatives by the bank and be responsible to follow the Financial Literacy Guidelines by Bangladesh Bank. Some of the core responsibilities of the members of the wing are— administering the financial literacy programs and reporting to the supervising authority BB and others.',\n",

In accordance with the total number of branches and Sub branches, the wing planned to conduct a total of 12 literacy programs for the first year which will be held in different regions of Bangladesh for a diversified but also rapid financial inclusion. Soon the FLW will conduct financial literacy programs by engaging branches, sub-branches, agent banking outlets and unit offices.',\n",
